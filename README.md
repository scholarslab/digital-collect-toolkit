Repo for Digital Collecting Toolkit

This site uses a customized version of components of the Jekyll theme, [Just the Docs](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/). Not all components from the original theme are included, but does include _sass, assets/css/, assets/js, [search](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/docs/search/), [navigation structure](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/docs/navigation-structure/), and some [configuration settings](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/docs/configuration/).

To update the site's styling, edit files in _sass/ directly. Variables for site typography, colors, spacing, media-queries, etc., can be found in _sass/support/_variables
